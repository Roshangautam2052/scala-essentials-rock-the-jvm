# 🚀 Scala Fundamentals & Functional Programming Course

**Updated for Scala 3 – Compatible with Scala 2 and 3**

Welcome to the repository for my hands-on learning journey through a comprehensive Scala and Functional Programming course. 
## 📚 Course Overview

This course dives into the **Scala language** and the principles of **functional programming**, two of the most sought-after skills in today’s software industry.

### 🔑 Why Scala?
- Built on the JVM – integrates seamlessly with Java
- High demand & salary potential (often >20% above similar Java roles)
- Opens the door to cutting-edge technologies: **Spark**, **Akka**, **Play**
- Powerful and fun once mastered

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this course, I developed the ability to:

- Understand and write idiomatic Scala code in real-world environments
- Apply **functional programming** paradigms effectively
- Build full applications from scratch using Scala
- Read, understand, and contribute to **open-source Scala projects**
- Prepare for technologies built on Scala (Spark, Akka, Play Framework)
